# Building Byteball for iOS

Apple takes cautious approach to new cryptocurrencies and didn't approve our app for the App Store (yet).  Fortunately, if you own a Mac, you can build and install Byteball for your iPhone yourself:

1. Download [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (4.5GB), if not already.
1. Sign up for [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/) (if not already), it's free.
1. Download [Byteball Xcode project](../../releases/download/v2.3.0/ios-xcode-project.zip), it contains all the source code necessary to build.
1. Unzip and open Byteball.xcodeproj in Xcode.
1. Select a Team in the project properties.
1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB.
1. Build Byteball by clicking Play button in Xcode.

Read [more detailed instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2016/01/12/howto-sideload-apps-iphone-ipad-xcode/) (for another app).  It is one of the easiest ways to try open-source apps that are not on the App Store.
